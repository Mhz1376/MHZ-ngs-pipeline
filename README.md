# MHZ-ngs-pipeline

A comprehensive NGS processing and variant analysis pipeline developed for the research published in *"Inherited Antigen-Presentation Failure Through Germline HLA Variants: A Fundamental Mechanism in Breast Cancer Predisposition"*.

## Overview

This repository contains the complete bioinformatics workflow used to analyze next-generation sequencing data and identify germline  variants associated with breast cancer predisposition. The pipeline integrates quality control, alignment, variant calling, and statistical modeling to investigate the relationship between  variants and cancer susceptibility.

## Repository Structure

### `ngs_pipeline/`
Contains the complete NGS data processing workflow including:
- Raw data quality control and preprocessing
- Reference genome alignment
- Variant calling and filtering
- Annotation
- Quality metrics and reporting

Detailed documentation of each processing step is provided within the directory.

### `statistical_models/`
Includes four comprehensive statistical models used in the analysis:
- Model 1: [Internal]
- Model 2: [External: Fisher] 
- Model 3: [External: Barnard]
- Model 4: [External: Bayesian]

Each model includes source code, documentation, and validation scripts.

## Data Availability

### Primary Dataset
The complete dataset is publicly available on Zenodo:
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16811086
